# multi-agent-page-sorter

> *The page consortium*

Coordinates multiple LLMs to sort an unordered collection of pages.

## Setup

requires poetry - see poetry docs (but perhaps just try `pip install poetry`). This is for managing python virtual environments.

With poetry, run `poetry install` in the root of the project install deps.
